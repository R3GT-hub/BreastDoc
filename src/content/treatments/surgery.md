**Surgery** is a common treatment for breast cancer and involves the removal of cancerous tissue from the breast. The two main types are **lumpectomy** (removing the tumor and a small margin of surrounding tissue) and **mastectomy** (removing the entire breast).

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Immediate removal of cancerous tissue, potentially curative for early-stage breast cancer.
- Can be combined with other treatments like radiation therapy for better outcomes.

**Cons:**

- Physical and emotional impact of losing part or all of a breast, which can affect body image and self-esteem.
- Possible complications such as infection, bleeding, or lymphedema (swelling due to lymph fluid buildup).

## Short and Long Term Effects

**Short Term:**

- Pain and swelling immediately after surgery, which usually improve with time and medication.
- Risk of infection at the surgical site, which is typically managed with antibiotics.

**Long Term:**

- Potential changes in body image and self-esteem, especially with mastectomy.
- Risk of lymphedema, particularly after lymph node removal during surgery.

## Cost and Return on Investment

**Cost:**

- Varies widely based on the type of surgery, hospital fees, and healthcare system.
- Average cost ranges from $10,000 to $50,000, including pre-operative assessments, surgery, hospital stay, and post-operative care.

**Return on Investment:**

- High return on investment as surgery can be a life-saving procedure, especially for early-stage breast cancer.
- Reduces the need for further treatments if cancer is fully removed during surgery.
