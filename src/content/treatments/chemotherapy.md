**Chemotherapy** involves the use of drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. It can be used before surgery to shrink tumors or after surgery to eliminate remaining cancer cells.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Can shrink tumors before surgery, potentially allowing for less invasive surgeries.
- Effective against cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).
- Can be combined with other treatments like radiation or surgery to improve outcomes.
- Helps in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life in advanced stages of cancer.

**Cons:**

- Can cause significant side effects, such as nausea, hair loss, and fatigue.
- Requires multiple treatment cycles, which can be physically and emotionally exhausting.
- May lead to a weakened immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections.
- Some patients may experience chemotherapy resistance, making treatment less effective.

## Short and Long Term Effects

**Short Term:**

- Nausea and vomiting, often manageable with medications.
- Hair loss, which can be temporary and reversible after treatment ends.
- Fatigue and weakness, affecting daily activities and quality of life.
- Mouth sores and difficulty swallowing.
- Increased risk of infections due to lowered white blood cell counts.
- Changes in appetite and weight loss.

**Long Term:**

- Potential for long-term organ damage, particularly to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs.
- Risk of secondary cancers due to the mutagenic effects of chemotherapy drugs.
- Persistent fatigue and cognitive changes, sometimes referred to as "chemo brain".
- Fertility issues, including temporary or permanent infertility.
- Neuropathy, which involves tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet.

## Cost and Return on Investment

**Cost:**

- Costs can range from $10,000 to $100,000 depending on the drugs and duration.
- Additional costs include supportive care medications, hospital visits, and potential time off work.
- Costs can vary significantly based on the type of chemotherapy regimen and healthcare provider.

**Return on Investment:**

- High, particularly for aggressive cancers where chemotherapy can significantly improve survival rates.
- Often covered by insurance, though out-of-pocket expenses can still be substantial.
- Improved quality of life and symptom management in advanced cancer stages.
- The potential for long-term remission or cure in certain cancer types.
- Reduced healthcare costs in the long run by preventing cancer progression and related complications.
