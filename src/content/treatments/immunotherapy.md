**Immunotherapy** harnesses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. It includes treatments like checkpoint inhibitors that help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Can provide long-lasting responses, with some patients experiencing durable remission.
- Effective for certain hard-to-treat cancers, including some types of metastatic breast cancer.
- May have fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy.

**Cons:**

- Can cause immune-related side effects such as fatigue, skin rashes, and inflammation in various organs.
- Not effective for all types of breast cancer, particularly hormone receptor-positive breast cancers.

## Short and Long Term Effects

**Short Term:**

- Fatigue, which may improve over time but can affect daily activities.
- Skin rashes or itching, often manageable with medications.

**Long Term:**

- Potential for autoimmune reactions, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells or organs.
- Risk of long-term changes in the immune system, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.

## Cost and Return on Investment

**Cost:**

- Typically ranges from $100,000 to $200,000 per year depending on the specific immunotherapy drug and treatment regimen.
- Additional costs may include monitoring for side effects and managing immune-related complications.

**Return on Investment:**

- High for eligible patients who respond well to immunotherapy, with the potential for long-term survival and improved quality of life.
- Often covered by insurance, although coverage may vary based on the specific drug and treatment setting.
- Continued research and development in immunotherapy are expanding its applications and improving outcomes for cancer patients.
