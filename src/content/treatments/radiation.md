**Radiation Therapy** uses high-energy rays to target and kill cancer cells. It is often used after surgery to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Effective in reducing the risk of cancer recurrence, improving long-term outcomes.
- Non-invasive procedure that does not require surgery.

**Cons:**

- Can cause skin irritation and fatigue during treatment.
- Requires multiple sessions over several weeks, which can be time-consuming.

## Short and Long Term Effects

**Short Term:**

- Skin changes, similar to a sunburn, which usually resolve after treatment ends.
- Fatigue during and shortly after treatment, which typically improves over time.

**Long Term:**

- Potential for permanent skin changes in the treated area, such as darkening or scarring.
- Rarely, there may be damage to nearby organs like the heart or lungs, although modern techniques aim to minimize these risks.

## Cost and Return on Investment

**Cost:**

- Generally ranges from $8,000 to $15,000 for a full course of radiation therapy, depending on the treatment area and complexity.
- Additional costs may include imaging scans for treatment planning and follow-up appointments.

**Return on Investment:**

- High return on investment due to its effectiveness in preventing cancer recurrence and improving survival rates.
- Often covered by insurance, although coverage may vary based on the specific treatment plan and insurance provider.
- Advances in technology continue to improve the precision and effectiveness of radiation therapy while minimizing side effects.
