**Hormone Therapy** blocks or lowers the levels of hormones that fuel some types of breast cancer. Common medications include Tamoxifen and Aromatase inhibitors.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Effective for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, which is a common subtype.
- Can be taken as pills, making it convenient for long-term use.
- Reduces the risk of cancer recurrence in hormone-sensitive tumors.
- May help shrink tumors before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy).

**Cons:**

- Only works on hormone receptor-positive cancers, not effective for hormone receptor-negative cancers.
- Can cause menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.
- Long-term use may increase the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.
- There is a potential for serious side effects like blood clots or uterine cancer, especially with certain types of hormone therapy.

## Short and Long Term Effects

**Short Term:**

- Hot flashes, which can be managed with lifestyle changes or medications.
- Vaginal dryness and discomfort, affecting sexual health and quality of life.

**Long Term:**

- Increased risk of osteoporosis due to hormonal changes affecting bone density.
- Potential for blood clots, particularly with estrogen-based hormone therapies.
- Risk of uterine cancer, especially with prolonged use of estrogen-only hormone therapy without a progestin component.

## Cost and Return on Investment

**Cost:**

- Typically ranges from $100 to $500 per month depending on the specific medication and dosage.
- Additional costs may include regular doctor visits, lab tests, and monitoring for side effects.

**Return on Investment:**

- High for hormone receptor-positive cancers, where hormone therapy can significantly improve survival rates and reduce recurrence.
- Often covered by insurance, making it more accessible for patients.
- Improved quality of life by managing symptoms and reducing the need for more aggressive treatments.
- Potential cost savings by preventing cancer recurrence and related healthcare expenses.
